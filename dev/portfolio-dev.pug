            | WBG solves a problem that only snobby beer drinks would have (if they would ever entertain a webapp such as this anyway).
          p
            | Because the data from breweryDB is open source, not all folks include recommended glassware with each beer or beer style. Therefore, WBG only captures beer styles with paired glassware.
